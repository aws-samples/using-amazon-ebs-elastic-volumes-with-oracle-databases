## Using Amazon EBS elastic volumes with Oracle databases

The three part blog series, [Using Amazon EBS elastic volumes with Oracle
databases](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/using-amazon-ebs-elastic-volumes-with-oracle-databases-part-1-introduction/)
demonstrates how to use the EBS Elastic Volumes feature with Oracle databases.
[Part
1](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/using-amazon-ebs-elastic-volumes-with-oracle-databases-part-1-introduction/)
covers using elastic volumes with Oracle databases using an operating-system
file system without a Logical Volume Manager (LVM) for database storage
management. [Part
2](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/using-amazon-ebs-elastic-volumes-with-oracle-databases-part-2-databases-using-lvm/)
covers Oracle databases that use an LVM for database storage management. [Part
3](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/using-amazon-ebs-elastic-volumes-with-oracle-databases-part-3-databases-using-oracle-asm/)
covers Oracle databases that use Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle
ASM).

This project contains the database scripts, and OS and AWS CLI commands used in
the blog posts.
